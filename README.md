Cash Flow Ultimate

Version 28: Hardcore Grind Edition

Cash Flow Ultimate is a high-fidelity economic simulation software built on the Electron framework. Designed for long-term strategic engagement, this application simulates a hyper-inflationary economy, a volatility-based stock market, and complex asset management systems.

Unlike standard idle games, this simulation employs exponential cost scaling and rigorous integrity checks to ensure a challenging progression curve.

System Overview

The software operates as a standalone, portable executable. It integrates a reactive frontend with a Node.js backend to handle complex calculations regarding compound interest, market trends, and secure data persistence.

Key Features

Dynamic Algorithmic Market
The financial module utilizes a custom algorithm simulating Brownian motion with mean reversion. Asset prices update in real-time intervals, requiring the user to analyze trends for optimal entry and exit points. The interface includes tools for immediate liquidity execution (Buy/Sell Max).

Economic Scaling & Asset Management
The simulation features over 35 distinct business tiers, ranging from small-scale operations to theoretical megastructures. Cost scaling is set to a factor of 2.1x, enforcing a steep difficulty curve that necessitates the transition from active input to passive, automated revenue streams via the Manager system.

Integrity Enforcement (Anti-Cheat)
To maintain simulation balance, the engine includes a heuristic input monitor. Input rates exceeding human feasibility (20+ events per second) trigger an automatic lockout protocol and a 10% liquidity penalty. This system ensures the integrity of the progression metrics.

Secure Persistence
Save data is serialized into a binary format, salted, and encoded to prevent local file tampering. The application automatically reroutes cache paths to ensure stability across different Windows GPU configurations.

Installation and Usage

Cash Flow Ultimate is distributed as a portable executable. It does not require an installation wizard, registry changes, or administrative privileges.
